When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
    
    A remote repository can sharing with others and modified and developed by others and 
can down the remote repository when the local computer went wrong.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    somechanges maybe not want to be needed and destory the current work on local.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
    
    forks£ºclone from one github user to other github users .
           wanting to need or modify others'little codes.
    clones£ºcopy the entire files from the github to local computer.
            wanting to need or modify others'codes.
    branches£ºcreat a new branch in the log on local.
              creating new features.   

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is that will have a common ancestor commit ,we can know the changes
of both clearly.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I will send the codes and instructions to collaborate company.Using Git or GitHub
would be easier. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when I want to add some feature new and I can not prove the codes about feature 
absolutely right,I want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master.separate branch:donnot influence the function of repository and change it 
you want.master branch:be sure that the repository is right forever.
